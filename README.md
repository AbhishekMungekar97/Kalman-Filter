## Weather prediction Algorithm based on Kalman filter
### - Kalman filters are often utilized in scenarios where we have uncertain information about a dynamical system. The best part of it is that it depends on its previous state, hence makes them very memory efficient.
### - This particular attribute of the Kalman filters, makes them well suited for real time problems.
### - This notebook will essentially focus on includes developing a weather prediction algorithm based on non-linear functions, using the classic Kalman filter.
